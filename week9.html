				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					This past week I spent most of my free time meeting up with my partner and working on the third project. My partner and I's schedules didn't match up very well over spring break so we didn't get any time to work on it during it. We still were able to do most of the work in two different days and spent about half the time we spent originally coding it on debugging edge cases.
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
					This week there isn't much is in my way yet. The next project isn't due for another week so I don't have anything too important to worry about. 
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I'm going to find a new partner to work on project four on and try to get at least half done by the end of the weekend. 
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					I enjoyed Professor Downing's sense of humor especially this week, I like his commentary on things like Valgrind. The humor helps to cement his point in my mind.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>		
					This week my tip-of-the-week is this <a href="https://stateofprogress.blog/choose-sql-d017cfc08870#.8y5bntfxc">article</a> detailing why you should just stick with SQL in most cases instead of using an alternative. I'm a proponent of this mainly because it's much more useful in most cases to stick with the tried and true instead of trying to implement underused and technologically superior alternatives. In many cases where you attempt this, lack of practical documentation and the presence of undiscovered bugs can impact the scalability of your code and your ability to implement new features in a timely manner.
