				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					As a side project I've been updating this blog with Bootstrap 3, but besides that this week I've been tackling our first project in the class which is based around something called the Collatz Conjecture. It states that if you take any number and multiply it by three and add one when its odd, and divide it by two when its even then it will eventually converge at one. The project asks us to design code that can determine the number with the longest sequence of iterations stating from one to the original number, and to do that within 2 seconds.
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
					Right now I have to implement some optimizations to my code in order to get it to compute the answer within two seconds. So far I've got the code outputting the correct answer with some minor optimizations but I still have to implement caching in order to improve the performance greatly.		
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I'll be starting on the next project for this class a little bit earlier than this one. Right now I'm working part time on the weekends and it really cuts into the time I expect to have to code, so I'll compensate for it by starting as early as possible.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					I'm still enjoying the class greatly. Professor Downing delves into plenty of intricacies that C++, C, and Java have and that is really interesting for me. Every class Professor downing picks students from a list to answer a few questions and each time I go in certain that I'll be one of them this time, but so far I still haven't been called on. I'm guessing this week It'll finally make its way to me.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>
					With all of the interviews I've been going through lately I feel a great pick-of-the-week is this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/">Reddit post</a> about the most commonly asked coding questions asked in interviews. I saw plenty of questions that I was asked recently in this list so I also feel it's a valuable resource to study.
