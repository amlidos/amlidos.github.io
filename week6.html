				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					I appreciated a much needed break that was afforded to us this past week. As opposed to us balancing class and a project, this week we focused on some new concepts in class while we prepare for the upcoming exam. In the beginning of the week we talked about MapReduce, a programming model for processing large data sets with a parallel distributed algorithm. Later in the week we learned about how classes are implemented in C++, and how to use member initialization lists. 
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
					Currently I have to set aside a day that works for a friend and I to look through all the material we've gone through in class up to now so that I can be adequately ready for the exam.
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I'm going to go through the entire study guide in order to prepare for the exam that is heading our way. I also plan on coding each of the functions we implemented in class one more time so I can make sure that I understand how each works conceptually.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					The class has remained exceptionally engaging to be a part of, and every day we get to the heart of several programming nuances. I'm continuing to enjoy going to class, and I'm getting much better at analyzing the coding questions we are often given in our daily quizzes.	
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>		
					This week, keeping in line with the heightened attention being given to unit and acceptance tests, my pick-of-the-week is this <a href="http://codelegance.com/effective-code-review-with-two-simple-rules/">article</a> from Codelegance that provides some useful guidelines to follow when reviewing someone's code.
