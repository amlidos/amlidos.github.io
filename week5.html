				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					During this last week my partner and I finished up the Australian Voting project. Our first implementation of the project was the simplest method of implementation we could come up with. We iterated over all the ballots and reassigned them as we saw fit. In our second optimized version of the code we stored the ballots in a map so that each candidate was assigned a 2D vector containing the ballots that are currently assigned to him. The optimized version of the code was much easier to imagine and write, which just goes to show that knowing all of the data structures available to you makes your job easier as a programmer, and serves to make your code more efficient.
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
					I have one important thing in my way at the moment. I'd like to dedicate a day to studying for the test that's coming up in this class. I plan on looking over all the past quizzes and making sure that I have a grasp on all of the content. After I finish that I'm going to look over all of the notes. 	
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I'll be focused on studying for the test, and reading the chapters assigned to us.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					Class this week has been pretty fun. Professor Downing used some analogies that were both funny and easy to grasp in order to explain how const is used in C++, both for pointers and values.		
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>		
					My pick-of-the-week this week is the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2017/#mailing2017-02">proposal list</a> for the upcoming C++ revisions. While C++17 is done, it's not yet the standard. However, we still have every revision after that to look into, and it's really cool to see what might be added into C++18 and beyond!
