				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					This past week we finished up the last daily quizzes of the semester. Beside focusing on studying the notes before each class I've been brushing up on the various object oriented concepts that we've gone over throughout the semester so that I can prepare for the exam this Thursday. We've learned a lot of over the course of the class so it's one of the harder comprehensive exams to study for compared to my other classes this semester.
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
					I'll have to get a lot of study time in so that I feel fully prepared for the exam. I also have to set aside some time to write up a double sided sheet of notes, as we are allowed to have one available during the exam.
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I'll be done with all of my classes, and by some stroke of luck only one of my classes has a final so I'll be dedicating all of my time to brushing up on Calculus during dead week. 
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					I enjoyed class this week, which feels redundant to say after saying the same thing for fourteen weeks, but I genuinely did. There are a few courses I really don't look forward to, but I enjoy the lecture and time seems to go by fast in OOP.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>		
					My pick-of-the-week this week is this <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/reckon-youve-seen-some-stupid-security-things-here-hold-my-beer/">article</a> with the silliest examples of security that have been implemented by companies. It's both hilarious and terrifying to see all of the ways that corporations have neglected to take care of our data.
