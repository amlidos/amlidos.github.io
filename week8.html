				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					This past week Professor Downing explained the details of project 3 to us. Essentially we are supposed to create a memory allocator that acts like the heap. We also talked a bit about how when you create an array in C++ the destructors of the objects inside don't get called automatically, you have to use delete[] to call them. I also met up with my partner at his apartment and we set up all the necessary files and repositories for the new project. We ended the day by finishing up our read function.
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
					I still have to dedicate some time to working out the specifics of how to implement the allocator for project 3. I've come up with some base cases for situations the program will run into, but my partner and I haven't written anything out yet. 
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I plan on meeting up with my partner again and working on the rest of the project. Since we already finished our read function, we'll do the print function next which should be trivial. Afterwards we'll use most of our time writing our solve function. Spring break is a nice break from the grind, as I have only had one off day from work and class in almost 3 months. I plan on refreshing myself before I return back to college.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					The class was great this week. I especially appreciated checking my phone Thursday night and seeing that Professor Downing gave us Friday off since we had spring break coming up this week.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>		
					This week my pick-of-the-week is this <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/notepad-7.3.3-fix-cia-hacking-issue.html">update</a> from Notepad++ which includes a fix to prevent one of the apparent DLL replacements built by the CIA. Vault 7, the recently released set of documents from WikiLeaks, tipped its hat to this.
