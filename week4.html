				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					This past week my partner and I got together in the GDC and began our work on project 2. The project is called Australian Voting as the focus of it is simulating the way elections take place in Australia. In the United States votes going towards Republicans or Democrats tend to be the only ones that have any effect. However, in Australia everyone ranks their choices so that in some cases if their vote was inconsequential, then their next ranked candidate will be counted instead. We coded a function to read in the data for the test cases and we also coded the simplest possible implementation we could devise. I also have been preparing myself for this weeks Technology & Science Career Fair by attending some preparatory seminars, revamping my resume, buying a new suit, and looking at the internships employers are hiring for.
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
				The biggest thing in my way right now is restructuring our code for the project so that it is more object oriented. Our plan is to separate the code into three different functions, one which reads, one which writes, one which solves a test case, and lastly of course a method which puts it all together and prints out our solution.		
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I plan on starting project 3 early like I did with project 2 in order to stay ahead of the deadline. I'll also have to take some time to get this weeks reading done a bit late as I've been too busy to get it done over the weekend. I've been preoccupied studying for two exams but I'm looking forward to the reading for this class as well!.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					I'm still enjoying going to every lecture. Out of every class that I've taken in Computer Science, this seems to go the most in depth into how specific operators work at more than a superficial level. I'm also enjoying the assigned readings, they're giving me a new perspective to consider when designing software. I plan on challenging myself to design all of the software I write to follow the Single Responsibility Principle.		
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>
					My pick-of-the-week this week is <a href="https://aboullaite.me/docker-hacks/">'15 Docker Hacks & Tips.'</a> I personally love any tool that saves me from installing an operating system or dealing with the inherent performance issues full virtual machines have to deal with. Docker thankfully utilizes runC so it gets to share plenty of the host operating system's resources!
