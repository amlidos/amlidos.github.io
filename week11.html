				<h3>What did you do this past week?</h3>
				<p>
					This week I spent most of time distributing my time between studying for an exam in Marketing and finishing Darwin. My partner and I ran into several issues with our implementation, but because our scheudles did not line up very nicely and because I've had three exams during this project we had to turn it in a day late. While the logic of our implementation worked, we were having trouble optimizing it without rewriting the majority of the code.
				</p>
					<h3>What's in your way?</h3>
				<p>
					Nothing is in my way at the moment that is too major. I'm planning on looking for a partner for the last project, but that shouldn't be a problem.
				</p>
					<h3>What will you do next week?</h3>
				<p>
					Next week I'm going to start as early as I can on the last project so that I don't have to turn in another project late. I'm trying my best to make an A in the class and I'm on track to do that as long as I do well on the final project and test.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my experience of the class?</h3>
				<p>
					Class was really interesting this week. We learned about the move constructor which essentially steals the value from what is passed in. It's a strange name for what it does, but it definitely has its uses.
				</p>
					<h3>What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h3>
				<p>		
					Today's pick-of-the-week is a great <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-not-to-design-netflix-in-your-45-minute-system-design-interview-64953391a054">article</a> on how you should handle a distributed systems interview. This can be one of the most challenging interview formats for programmers because we don't typically focus on this in our classes. Usually we focus on implementing specifics, but I for one can vouch that I need more practice in complex, scalable system design.
